# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added

- **npm package** — installable via `npm install -g fortimanager-code-mode-mcp` or `npx fortimanager-code-mode-mcp`
- **Binary entry point** — `fortimanager-mcp` CLI command via `bin` field in package.json

### Changed

- **Stable release** — promoted from Beta to v1.0.0 public release
- README updated with npm/npx installation instructions and `npx` examples for VS Code Copilot and Claude Desktop
- Repository visibility changed to public

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added

- **VS Code Copilot integration** — `.vscode/mcp.json.example` template and setup docs
- **HTTP transport rate limiting** — sliding-window limiter (60 req/min per client IP) with X-Forwarded-For support
- **Request logging and audit trail** — tool call logging with code size, duration, and result status
- **Enhanced `/health` endpoint** — now returns uptime and request stats (total, MCP, rate-limited, errors)
- **10 end-to-end scenario tests** (`scripts/e2e-test.ts`) covering real agent workflows against live FortiManager
- **Architecture deep-dive** (`docs/architecture.md`) — component details, data flow, security model
- **Usage guide** (`docs/usage-guide.md`) — search/execute workflows, error handling, best practices
- **Troubleshooting guide** (`docs/troubleshooting.md`) — common issues, error codes, permission matrix

### Fixed

- **Build script** now copies spec JSON files to `dist/spec/` (was failing with ENOENT)
- **Sandbox `await` issue** — removed `await` from execute tool examples; `fortimanager.request()` is synchronous in QuickJS sandbox
- **Tool descriptions** refined with accurate method names (`get-obj`/`get-table`), module filtering examples, and `function()` syntax

### Changed

- Tool description for `search` — documents `module` field, method names, and module filtering
- Tool description for `execute` — documents `status.code` semantics and error handling patterns
- README status upgraded from Alpha to Beta
- Expanded Security documentation with 15 hardening measures

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added

- **MCP Server** with 2 tools (`search` + `execute`) using the Code Mode pattern
- **FortiManager JSON-RPC client** with token-based authentication and SSL bypass support
- **QuickJS WASM sandbox** for secure agent code execution (memory/CPU limited)
- **API spec generator** parsing FortiManager HTML docs into structured JSON
- **Dual API version support** — FortiManager 7.4.9 (72 modules, 17,426 objects) and 7.6.5 (82 modules, 22,060 objects)
- **Dual transport** — Stdio (local dev / Claude Desktop) and Streamable HTTP (Docker / production)
- **Docker** multi-stage Alpine build with health checks and non-root user
- **Docker Compose** configuration with env_file support
- **CI/CD pipelines** — GitHub Actions for lint, typecheck, test, build, Docker push, and releases
- **66 unit tests** across 5 suites (client, search executor, code executor, server, config)
- **86 integration tests** across 8 groups: spec globals, edge cases, cross-reference validation, system ops, CRUD lifecycle, error handling, advanced operations, and stability stress tests
- **API coverage report** (`scripts/spec-coverage.ts`) — offline spec analysis, cross-version comparison (v7.4 vs v7.6), and live URL validation with stratified sampling (96% validation rate on 100-URL sample)
- **Performance tuning** — pre-computed JSON caches, WASM pre-warming, API call limits (50/execution), response truncation (100 KB)
- Community files: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, issue/PR templates
- Git LFS tracking for large API spec JSON files

### Security

- **Sandboxed execution** — all agent code runs in QuickJS WASM with memory/CPU limits, no `eval` in host
- **HTTP request timeout** (30s) prevents indefinite hang on slow/unreachable FortiManager
- **JSON-RPC response shape validation** prevents crashes from non-JSON-RPC responses
- **Sandbox method validation** ensures only allowed FMG methods (`get`, `set`, `add`, etc.) are forwarded
- **Sandbox params validation** verifies params is an array with required `url` field before forwarding
- **Log accumulation cap** (1 MB / 1,000 entries) prevents host OOM from runaway console.log
- **Code input size limit** (100 KB) prevents oversized code payloads
- **SSL fallback hardened** — throws error instead of silently downgrading when undici unavailable
- **Input validation** with Zod for all environment variables
- **Graceful shutdown** for both stdio and HTTP transports with signal deduplication
- **Startup health check** validates FortiManager connectivity at boot
